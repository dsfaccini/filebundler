# Big TODOs

## Add a gemini LLM utility
1. we need to update the input field where the user enters the anthropic key, it should read differently depending on what model provider the user chooses to use. Any API key entered needs to be cached in the app state

## MCP tools
1. project structure tool (`project-structure.md` isn't initialized if the user doesn't run the web ap or CLI) so the agent should be able to get it from the MCP server directly.

## Codebase indexing
**TODO**
1.  make a tab to index the codebase

## TESTING
1. [TEST] we haven't written any test

## MY TODOs
1. [DOCS] add more pictures to README
2. [DOCS] make a video
3. [TODO] remove logfire for now.
