# File Bundler
File Bundler is an app to bundle project files together and use them for LLM prompting. It helps estimate and optimize token and context usage.

# Attributions
File Bundler is inspired by [Repo Prompt](https://x.com/RepoPrompt), which I believe is built by @pvncher.
At the time of this writing Repo Prompt is waitlisted and doesn't support Windows, which prompted me (badum tss) to start this project.
